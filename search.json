    "text": "1.5 Step 5: Automate Deployment with GitHub Actions\nThis is something I’ve found works best for me and my workstyle when creating these modules. Instead of ever rendering my work locally and then publishing this to GitHub I include a GitHub Action command so that when I commit and push changes to the repository GitHub will automatically render the new outputs to the gh-pages site.\nManually building and deploying our project every time we make a change can be time-consuming and prone to error. So by configuring GitHub Actions, we can automate the entire publishing process. Whenever we push changes to the repository (e.g., updated content, code adjustments), GitHub Actions will automatically trigger the workflow to build and deploy our site. Which saves us time and reduces manual effort. This also helps ensure that everyone is working on the most recent version of the materials, with automatic deployment occurring in the background.\n\n1.5.1 Set up\nMore detials on setting up GitHub actions can be found here: https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html.\n\nIn your Quarto project directory, create a folder called .github/worflows\nInside .github/workflows/, create a file called quarto-publish.yml - You do this from within RStudio by heading to the files pane and into the workflows folder → new blank file → Text file and this opens up in R studio and then save this as quarto-publish.yml\nAdd the following content to the quarto-publish.yml\n\n\non:\n  workflow_dispatch:\n  push:\n    branches: main\n\nname: Quarto Publish\n\njobs:\n  build-deploy:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    permissions:\n      contents: write\n    steps:\n      - name: Check out repository\n        uses: actions/checkout@v4\n\n      - name: Set up Quarto\n        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/setup@v2\n\n      - name: Install R\n        uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r@v2\n        with:\n          r-version: '4.2.0'\n\n      - name: Install R Dependencies\n        uses: r-lib/actions/setup-renv@v2\n        with:\n          cache-version: 1\n\n      - name: Install TinyTeX\n        run: |\n          Rscript -e 'tinytex::install_tinytex(force = TRUE)'\n          echo \"PATH=$HOME/.TinyTeX/bin/x86_64-linux:$PATH\" &gt;&gt; $GITHUB_ENV\n\n      - name: Ensure TinyTeX Path\n        run: echo \"$HOME/.TinyTeX/bin/x86_64-linux\" &gt;&gt; $GITHUB_PATH\n\n      - name: Render and Publish\n        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/publish@v2\n        with:\n          target: gh-pages\n        env:\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n\ncall renv::snapshot(), snapshot() updates the lockfile with metadata about the currently-used packages in the project library.\n\nThis quarto-publish.yml I have worked on standardising across the projects I’ve developed for the Data Fellows so far - should you have any issues please reach out to Hayley to help troubleshoot!\nOther options for publishing content can be found here: https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/",

    "text": "1.8 Step 8 Adding content\nNow we have all the set up out the way we can start adding our content and updating the themeing!\nThis step will be very context depenent on the type of materials we want to add to our modules so I have outlined some common steps across materials that have been built so far and we can always add more as we go.\nThe Quarto Guide is going to be super useful https://quarto.org/docs/guide/ especially if you’re new to working in Markdown - I won’t replicate the resources here and recommend using the Quarto guide as a reference point when writing in Quarto.\nThere is always the option in Quarto to use the visual editor - this simplifies the process of writing and formatting content in markdown formats and allows users to focus on writing without needing to remember markdown syntax, making it easier for beginners and those unfamiliar with code-based formatting. The Visual Editor provides an interface similar to popular word processors like Microsoft Word or Google Docs.\nThe Visual Editor includes toolbars with buttons for common formatting options such as:\n\nBold and italic text\nCreating headings and subheadings\nAdding bullet points or numbered lists\nInserting links, images, and tables\nAdding callouts for notes, warnings, or tips\nYou can still insert and edit code chunks directly in the Visual Editor. These code chunks are executed as usual, and their outputs (tables, figures, etc.) are displayed inline, making it easier to integrate code into your documents.\n\nTo use the Visual Editor in RStudio or other supported IDEs:\n\nOpen any Quarto (.qmd) or markdown file in your project.\nClick the “Visual” button in the top right corner of the editor pane to toggle between the standard markdown editor and the Visual Editor.\n\n\n1.8.1 Understanding the _quarto.yml file\nThe _quarto.yml file is a configuration file that controls the structure and appearance of your Quarto project, such as the website’s title, menu, and theme.\nFor a Quarto book, the _quarto.yml file specifies the structure, appearance, and behavior of the book. Below is an example of what the structure might look like and what you will see when you open this initially in your project.\n\nproject:\n  type: book\n\nbook:\n  title: \"My Quarto Book\"\n  author: \"Author Name\"\n  chapters:\n    - index.qmd\n    - introduction.qmd\n    - chapter1.qmd\n    - chapter2.qmd\n\nformat:\n  html:\n    theme: cosmo\n    toc: true\n    number-sections: true\n    css: styles.css\nWe want to start by modifying the title and author fields under book to what is relevant for the module (we can just delete the author line as it’s not needed here)\nWe can also add a subtitle that’s nice to include in all our topics like this:\nbook:\n  title: Foundational Malaria Knowledge\n  subtitle: MACEPA Data Fellowship - Training Materials\nThe chapters section defines the order of the chapters in your book. It links to the .qmd files that will become the different sections of the book:\nbook:\n    chapters:\n        - index.qmd           # Main page or introduction\n        - introduction.qmd    # First chapter\n        - chapter1.qmd        # Subsequent chapters\n        - chapter2.qmd\nYou can add or remove chapter files as needed. Just make sure each file you list here exists in the project.\nFor some of our modules we have several topics within a module and sub topics within them so we can use the part as well as chapters to achieve something like this:\n\nTo do so you can set the _quarto.yml to something this:\n  chapters:\n  - index.qmd\n  - part: topic1-intro.qmd\n        chapters:\n        - topic1a-history-malaria.qmd\n        - topic1b-global-impact.qmd\n        - topic1c-endemicity.qmd\n  - part: topic2-intro.qmd\n        chapters: \n        - topic2a-plasmodium-spp.qmd\n        - topic2b-lifecycle.qmd\n        - topic2c-immunity.qmd \n   - part: topic3-intro.qmd\n        chapters: \n        - topic3a-anopheles-trans.qmd\n        - topic3b-environment.qmd\n        - topic3c-human-behaviour.qmd\n        \nIn each of these instances the title that is in the .qmd file becomes the heading that is shown on the final website as shown in the image above.\nOnce you start adding `.qmd` files with module content make sure to replace the defualt files and include these in the `_quarto.yml` to ensure the modules are displayed on the site. Often I start adding content to the templates and renaming the files before creating new `.qmd` files \n\n\n1.8.2 Adding custom styling\nWe’ve already created custom PATH theming and I’ve saved all the necessary files in the data-fellows box folder under ‘quarto-theming’ Data fellowship program planning → Technical Content Organization → quarto-theming\nCopy all of these into your root folder and add the following to your _quarto.yml file\nformat:\n  html:\n    theme:\n    - cosmo\n    - custom.scss\n    template-partials: title-block.html\n    css: include/webex.css\n    include-after-body: include/webex.js\n    embed-resources: true \n  pdf:\n    documentclass: scrreprt\neditor: visual\n\n\n1.8.3 Embedding PDFs\nIf you have a slide deck to host on the website we first need to save this as a pdf and ensure it it then saved in the same root directory of our Quarto project.\nYou can use the following syntax to embed the pdfs inside a .qmd file replacing the file name with the associated file name of your file.\n&lt;iframe src=\"file-name.pdf\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\"&gt;\n\n&lt;/iframe&gt; \n\n\n1.8.4 Embedding YouTube Videos\nIf you want to include videos hosted on YouTube an easy was to achieve this is with the following syntax, replacing the link with that to the video of interest:\n\n\n\n1.8.5 Interative Quizzes\nYou can use the webexercises packageto produce quizes and is what I used in the Foundational Epi module\nThe documentation is a good place to start here and the source code in the Foundational Epi Module repository if you want to develop something similar!\n\n\n1.8.6 Publishing content\nOnce you have created the necessary module content in .qmd files, have updated the _quarto.yml file with the correct references for each chapter we can again push out changes to github and check out our newly published site!\nRemeber:\n\ngit add . \ngit commit -m \"commit message\" \ngit push \nAnd it’s as simple as that!",

    "text": "1.9 Wrapping It All Together: Maintaining Your Quarto Project\nBy following these steps, you’ve built a robust workflow for creating, managing, and publishing your Quarto Book from scratch. Here are a few final tips to help you maintain and expand your project effectively:\n\nIterating on Content Content updates:\n\nAs your project evolves, you’ll likely need to update chapters or add new ones. Remember, every time you modify a .qmd file or create a new one, ensure that the _quarto.yml file is updated accordingly. Push these changes to GitHub to automatically deploy updates.\nVersion control: Keep track of your content changes by writing clear commit messages. This makes it easy to refer back to previous versions if needed.\n\nTroubleshooting Common Issues:\n\nBuild failures: Sometimes, your GitHub Actions may fail due to misconfigurations or syntax errors (e.g., in the _quarto.yml file). GitHub provides detailed logs for failed builds in the Actions tab, which can help pinpoint the issue.\nRendering issues: If the published site doesn’t display content as expected, double-check that your .qmd files are properly linked in the _quarto.yml file and that all references (images, links, etc.) are correctly specified.\n\nCollaboration and Feedback Collaborative development:\n\nIf you’re working with a team on the resources, consider using GitHub’s collaborative features like Pull Requests to review changes before they’re merged into the main branch. This can help catch errors early and maintain consistency across the project.\n\nEnsure that your project dependencies (tracked by renv.lock) are up to date by regularly running renv::snapshot() after installing new R packages. This ensures that your environment remains consistent across different systems.",
